# SVG Custom Exporter

This is as old project I made that I decided to share on GitHub.

It's a browser app that allows to easily export SVG files into PNG and JPG formats. 

The user can also specify the size of the exported image in pixels, millimetres, or inches.

It also allows the user to select which layers to include and change their fill colour.
